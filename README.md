# Flight Data Organizer

This repository contains two Python scripts, `organize_flight_data_mx.py` and `organize_flight_data_RGB.py`, which can be used to organize image data from drone flights.

It uses the pyexiftool library: https://sylikc.github.io/pyexiftool/examples.html
You will need to install exiftool, check: https://pypi.org/project/PyExifTool/

## Micasense Altum (MX) Data

The `organize_flight_data_mx.py` script can be used to organize data from Micasense Altum sensors, which capture images in five spectral bands plus thermal (band 6) that is not used for stitching.

To use the script, navigate to the folder containing the images and run the script. The script will read the metadata of the images and identify which images belong to which flight. It will then copy all of the multispectral images with all 5 bands to the output folder.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- exiftool
- PySimpleGUI

### Instructions

1. Install the requirements
2. Run the `organize_flight_data_mx.py` script
3. Choose an input folder
4. Choose an output folder
5. Enter a flight name
6. Enter the drone's minimum flight height in feet
7. Click "Submit"
8. Wait for the metadata to be checked and flights to be organized
9. Click "Submit" to move the files to the output folder

## DJI RGB Data

The `organize_flight_data_RGB.py` script can be used to organize data from DJI UAVs with their own RGB cameras.

To use the script, navigate to the folder containing the images and run the script. The script will read the metadata of the images and identify which images belong to which flight. It will then copy all of the images to the output folder.

### Requirements
